            <h2>üè∞ Our Story</h2>
            <p>Founded in a leaky Edinburgh basement during the 1992 British Championship (when Short beat Speelman), ChessBrit began as a handwritten zine, often stained with tea and desperation. We were circulated in chess clubs from Penzance to Thurso, passed between hands like a state secret. Today, we maintain that same grumpy-old-man approach to chess tuition. There are no flashy apps here, just solid, stubborn advice like your granddad used to give over a sticky chessboard in the pub.</p>
            <div class="fun-fact">
                <p><strong>Fun Fact:</strong> Our "Windsor Castle Gambit" was actually invented by Princess Margaret's butler during a rainy Balmoral weekend in '78. He claimed it was the perfect response to "impertinent pawn structures."</p>

                    <h3>The Blackpool Tower Attack</h3>
                    <div class="opening-moves"><pre>1. e4 e5   2. Nf3 Nc6   3. Bb5 a6
4. Ba4 Nf6   5. O-O b5   6. Bb3 Bc5</pre></div>
                    <p>Preys on British weaknesses: overprotecting pawns like tea biscuits and assuming the opponent will play "properly" (they never do).</p>
                    <p class="example"><strong>Pub Example:</strong> "Big Dave" from Manchester used this to defeat a FIDE Master by sacrificing both rooks like they were last orders at the bar.</p>
                </article>

... 9. h3 Na5</pre></div>
                    <p>Best played with a deep sigh. The knight's retreat looks passive, but it baits English players into overextending like they're colonizing the board.</p>
                    <p class="example"><strong>Verified:</strong> Works 73% of the time in drizzly weather (Glasgow study, 2019).</p>

4. Bg5 Be7   5. e3 ... h6!?</pre></div>
                    <p>A solid, stodgy setup. The goal is not to win brilliantly, but to present a defence so irritatingly solid that your opponent resigns out of sheer boredom.</p>
                    <p class="example"><strong>GM Hawkins noted:</strong> "It's the chess equivalent of a traffic jam on the M25. Nothing moves, and everyone's miserable."</p>

                    <p>Alistair achieved the Grandmaster title in 1988 and promptly retired from international chess, citing the "poor quality of hotel tea" as his main reason. He now serves as ChessBrit's chief theorist and agony uncle.</p>
                    <p>His chess philosophy is simple: "If a position is complicated, find a way to make it more so, then offer a draw from a position of moral superiority. Your opponent will be so confused they'll likely accept." Alistair spends his days annotating games, complaining about modern time controls, and perfecting his queen-and-biscuit fork.</p>

                        <li><strong>Loss:</strong> Muttering about the lighting, the wobbly table, or a draft.</li>
                        <li><strong>Blunder:</strong> A sharp intake of breath, followed by staring at the ceiling for two full minutes.</li>
